# mpv keybindings
#
# Location of user-defined bindings: ~/.config/mpv/input.conf
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Use SHARP to assign the # key.
# Copy this file and uncomment and edit the bindings you want to change.
#
# List of commands and further details: DOCS/man/input.rst
# List of special keys: --input-keylist
# Keybindings testing mode: mpv --input-test --force-window --idle
#
# Use 'ignore' to unbind a key fully (e.g. 'ctrl+a ignore').
#
# Strings need to be quoted and escaped:
#   KEY show-text "This is a single backslash: \\ and a quote: \" !"
#
# You can use modifier-key combinations like Shift+Left or Ctrl+Alt+x with
# the modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Meta (may not work on the terminal).
#
# The default keybindings are hardcoded into the mpv binary.
# You can disable them completely with: --no-input-default-bindings

# Developer note:
# On compilation, this file is baked into the mpv binary, and all lines are
# uncommented (unless '#' is followed by a space) - thus this file defines the
# default key bindings.

# If this is enabled, treat all the following bindings as default.
#default-bindings start

#MBTN_LEFT     ignore              # don't do anything
#MBTN_LEFT_DBL cycle fullscreen    # toggle fullscreen on/off
#MBTN_RIGHT    cycle pause         # toggle pause on/off

# Mouse wheels, touchpad or other input devices that have axes
# if the input devices supports precise scrolling it will also scale the
# numeric value accordingly
#WHEEL_UP      seek 10
#WHEEL_DOWN    seek -10
#WHEEL_LEFT    add volume -2
#WHEEL_RIGHT   add volume 2

## Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are limited by keyframes
RIGHT seek  3
LEFT  seek -3
UP    add volume 2
DOWN  add volume -2

# Vim-like
h seek -3
j add volume -2
k add volume 2
