To deploy these dotfiles is to use python's "dotfiles".

You can manage them manually if you want but I have found that to be a headache.

Installation Guide:

Make sure to have python-pip installed:

pip install dotfiles && git clone https://github/tw1zr/dotfiles ~/dotfiles && cp ~/dotfiles/.dotfilesrc ~/.dotfilesrc
